# Spring Dependency Injection Exercises

This repository contains exercises related to Spring dependency injection. Each exercise explores different aspects of dependency injection using annotations such as `@Autowired`, `@Qualifier`, `@Primary`, and interface-based injection.

## Exercise Descriptions:

1. **Interface-based Injection Exercise**
    - Explore how dependencies can be injected using both interface and implementation types.
    - Investigate any peculiarities or unexpected behavior when referencing a dependency with a different type than it was defined with.

2. **Final Field Injection Exercise**
    - Attempt to use `@Autowired` injection on a field that is marked as final.
    - Observe the behavior of Spring when injecting dependencies into final fields.

3. **Bean Injection without @Qualifier Exercise**
    - Try to inject a correct bean without using the `@Qualifier` annotation.
    - Explore an alternative approach to specifying which bean to inject when there are multiple candidates of the same type.

4. **Dependency Injection by Guru SpringFramework**
    - Utilize the examples and exercises provided by Guru SpringFramework to deepen your understanding of Spring dependency injection.
